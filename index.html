										<h2><a href="#">MY INTEREST<br />
										IN IT</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I want to develop a better understanding of Technological advances, be it related to video game, software engineering or hardware. Anything related to adapting to the 21st century. My interest began when I started to tinker and mess around with hardware from my old monitor pc or when I learn that there was 0 and 1 that display images. I couldn’t grasp the idea of what a how the world could transfer the light into systematic code that displayed an array of numbers. My online IT experience would be in year 9 when I was messing with power cables, learning how to solder, wire strip can connect power to circuit boards. After that learn how to program with LEGO Mindstorms. This was my first official exposure to programming with set directions and trying to meet constraints and considerations, followed by that in year 10 I was introduced to Arduino circuits where I had more information overload of programming. This initial made me step back from learning programming as I was lazy back in high school.

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I’ll be applying for a position as registered Architect, and the reason that this works for me is because of my ability to be creative and think critical at the same time. This path is something I’ve want to do since I was a kid. Being able to design and possibly build my dream houses. In most cases the organisation requires Registered Architects to be able to use fluently Revit, multi-res and public sector. The skill and qualifications I have now are just imaginative and creative thinking skills, ability to analyse and critically assess problems, ability to see the big picture as well as giving attention to the smallest detail. For me to obtain the skills and requirements, I would have to learn and study the program Revit and multi-res. Develop an understanding of public sector and what their roles are.</p>

									<p>TThese tests provide a nice indicator to where a person’s mentality and behaviour lie. It doesn’t define the person entirely who they are but provide a common ground to those who feel the same way.
To find out especially one’s personality trait, it can be either used as a strength or weakness. The reason I believe it to be so, is because per say a person is self-aware of their personality, some might feel self-conscious or award about their result. To some they see it as strength, using it to empower them and make them feel really good. This can go hand in hand for a team because it will affect the other members too. When considering forming a team, things to consider would be teams’ chemistry, team work and participation and positivity.

										<h2><a href="#">MY PROPOSAL PLAN<br />
										AND MY PRODJECT</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>My project proposal is to help developing countries design an idealistic house based around their resources available, affordability, structural integrity and aesthetics. To achieve this goal, I will be using AutoCAD to create 3D models and visually see if I am able to achieve these ideas I have constructed in my head. After creating trial designs, I will use Minecraft to build and replicated the locations environment and landscape, utilise this knowledge for me to better understand the terrain. I have chosen the location to be set in Mogadishu, Somalia; because it has a vast landscape that can be utilised to build Agriculture and Housing spaces. This is the satellite image of the over view of the location I will be redesigning to provide a more modern and affordable housing area for the citizen that live there.
