									<h1>Project X Proposal <br />
									AND PROJECT DESIGN</h1>
									<p>My project proposal is to help developing countries design an idealistic house based around their resources available, affordability, structural integrity and aesthetics. To achieve this goal, I will be using AutoCAD to create 3D models and visually see if I am able to achieve these ideas I have constructed in my head. After creating trial designs, I will use Minecraft to build and replicated the locations environment and landscape, utilise this knowledge for me to better understand the terrain. I have chosen the location to be set in Mogadishu, Somalia; because it has a vast landscape that can be utilised to build Agriculture and Housing spaces. This is the satellite image of the over view of the location I will be redesigning to provide a more modern and affordable housing area for the citizen that live there. </p>

								<p>I really want to incorporate Architectural design in my project, using AutoCAD and some other 3D modelling program to help me design or provide a foundation to my project. I think by doing so I’ll be one step closer to trying to get into my ideal job. This project is allowing me to use the different tools both in practical work sense and in videogame reality. Using Minecraft to allow me to endlessly create ideas and possibly find new ways to meet the needs of resources available, affordability, structural integrity and aesthetics. Minecraft has already done this called a Block by Block project. Where they use builders plans and incorporate in the real world as how I planned.
My service to the community is to provide a cheap and affordable housing and facilities that can be constructed with the available resources the community has available. My goal is to be able to help people in developing countries develop and prosper on their own by providing houses, schools, churches, and other facilities, so that when the community grows they are learning from each other and won’t have to rely on people that can’t help them as much. Once I design my drafts on AutoCAD I will share my designs to highest advisors who will look over my draft if the design is structurally sound, if not just repeat the process and refine the drawing till the advisor approves. I will print out my final AutoCAD design share it with the community if they would approve and if so, send it to the construction team on Minecraft building team and begin building a scale replica of our build plans.
With the location I have chosen Mogadishu, Somalia, specifically this satellite image is because it has plot already sorted out. Where once upgraded and updated with more greenery and housing facility is noticeably more expandable with the spacing availability.
What I’ve decide to do after drawing up my plan and sharing it with the Minecraft building team is to start allocating plots for each of the builds, flower beds and trees. We used cobblestone blocks as our template block. Our team decided to you these sets of blocks as our building pallet because of how accessible it might be in Somalia and other possible resources they can trade for their materials. We are using Clay/terracotta blocks, Bricks, Wood, Stone, Glass panes, Trap doors as other windows, Slabs, Grass Blocks and water.
With these blocks we plan to build 6x 3 Bedroom Houses, 1 Big School p-12, 1 Gym, 1 Gardening Hall, 20x Flower beds and 6 toilets both boys and girls.
We first started off using the cobblestone template and started building the houses, replacing them with terracotta and clay as the walls and flooring with wood. The house has 1 bathroom fitted with a shower provide by with clean water use and recycled with a filtering plant using materials readily available to the community. After designing the houses fitted with the essential needs such as bathroom, kitchen and bedroom. We moved on to creating a water plant outside the community plot where it can’t be affected by any people that want to ruin the water. Me and my team then began building the other facilities such as the gym and church. We are still in the process of designing the community just due to the level work and builds we are design need to be corrected. But I will update this page when we feel we’ve made significant updates to the community.


I need the ability to understand how scaling differs between AutoCAD and the real world, how the measurements seen on screen is translated into a ratio printed on paper. Followed by that I also need to have a basic understanding of geometry and physic for structural support and foundation.

I will initially be drawing my scale of the location by hand estimating by eye. Followed by that the software I will be using is AutoCAD to draw my floor plans and elevation. Then once I’m comfortable with the math I will be using Java Minecraft Edition to build the exterior and design the interior. I won’t be using and mods or spigot apps due to the processing power of my laptop where ill will be conducting most of my builds on. Minecraft ability to change the terrain means I can build on similar setup and environments when trying to replicate to as close as possible. 


The outcome I want to achieve out this is to be able to one day submit my designs and show that I have the capability to design structurally sound builds that is cheap, affordable and long lasting for many generations to come. Provide basic humanitarian needs that will help prosper in the local community. My builds hopefully be able to be used to build schools as well other recreational facilities and possibly change the way the community can do landscaping and agriculture. The impact on the community would not provide houses and school facilities for them but also using the school to educate their own people to build and develop their own designs which would help them with jobs and future careers.
